Regularization-based Diabetes Regression Analysis
Purpose
In this lab, researchers will test several regression models to forecast the process of diabetes using machine learning models. The main aims were to:
Compare various regression algorithms (Linear, Multiple Linear, Polynomial, Ridge, and Lasso)
Compare the idea of regularization methods in avoiding overfitting
Test the model and its performance by the standard metrics of regression
Use practical experience by working on the diabetes dataset of scikit-learn

Dataset
The project is based on an in-built diabetes dataset in scikit-learn that includes characteristics of physiological parameters that occur in patients with diabetes and a numeric database representing the degree of the progression of the disease. The data were preprocessed and divided into the training and testing parts to provide adequate model assessment.

Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression (Single Feature)
BMI was the only predictor variable used
It was used as the comparison point of reference
Proved the correlation between individual characteristics and the occurrence of diabetes development


2. Multiple Linear Regression
Included every possible attribute in the dataset
Conducted better performance than single-feature regression
Explained the significance of features and the connection among variables in a multivariate situation
3. Polynomial Regression (Degree 2)
Data in the form of non-linear relationships captured
Delegated complex patterns modeling to use the polynomial feature transformation
Illustrated the complexities of trade-offs in models versus interpretability
4. Ridge Regression (α = 1.0)
L2 regularization is used for overfitting prevention
Kept all characteristics and reduced coefficients
Optimized prediction and model complexity
5. Lasso Regression (α = 0.1)
Applied L1 regularization on feature selection
Added sparsity through the possible setting of a few coefficients to zero
It can be provided with automatic feature selection capabilities

Key Insights
Model Performance Comparison
Multiple Linear Regression had also significantly increased compared to the simple linear regression, which is one registered in the use of multiple predictors.
Utilization of Polynomial Regression ensured the capture of the non-linear relationship, but also necessitated lots of tuning to prevent overfitting.
Regularization methods (Ridge and Lasso) proved to be good in producing more stable models.
Regularization Benefits
Ridge regression managed to deal with the issue of multicollinearity and not remove any features.
Lasso regression performed the role of regularization and feature selection, which could help to determine the most significant predictors.
Both regularized models were robust, having good generalization performances.
Visualization Insights
Scatter plots helped to show the association between actual and predicted values.
The fact that points were clustering around the line of the diagonal showed that the model was performing well.
Plots of Ridge and Lasso regression had various similar patterns of predictions.

Evaluation Metrics
All models were evaluated using:
•	Mean Absolute Error (MAE): The Mean of the absolute errors of the predicted values and actual values
•	Mean Squared Error (MSE): The average of the difference squared that penalizes the greater errors more than the smaller ones
•	Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): the root of MSE; a measure of error in units of measurement
•	R-squared: The percentage of the variation of the model (the bigger the better fit)

Challenges and Decisions
Technical Challenges
Feature Scaling: Properly scaling features to achieve optimal model performance
Hyperparameter Tuning: Choose proper values of alpha in Ridge and Lasso regression
Model Comparison: Setting up healthy criteria of comparison between model types

Key Decisions Made
•	Train-Test Split: Standard splitting was used to generate an unbiased assessment of the model
•	Regularization Parameters:
•	Ridge (alpha=1.0): The ridge was selected so that moderate regularization was performed
•	Lasso (alpha= 0.1): Chosen to adjust between models and the feature selection
•	Polynomial Degree: Degree is restricted to 2 to avoid over-fitting
•	Visualization Strategy: Scatter plot visualization provided the ability to effectively communicate the performance and the prediction accuracy of the model
